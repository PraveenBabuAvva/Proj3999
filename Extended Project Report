## **Extended Project Abstract (up to 300 words):**  
Low illumination images are typically captured in low-light conditions and are often subjected to inconsistent environmental lighting, including overly bright or artificial light. Enhancement results from existing techniques frequently suffer from halo artifacts, unnatural color reproduction, and information loss, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, an algorithm based on a physical lighting model is proposed, which describes the degradation of poorly illuminated images. This model considers environmental light as a pointwise variable that adapts to local light sources. By accurately estimating the model parameters, low illumination images can be directly recovered.  

The proposed algorithm leverages the **Beta Hyperbolic Secant Distribution (BHSD)** to model the dynamic range of pixel intensities effectively. BHSD enhances the estimation of illumination parameters by providing a robust framework for balancing global and local intensity variations. This minimizes errors caused by extreme lighting inconsistencies, improving the precision of the recovered illumination map and leading to enhanced image quality.  

Incorporating **Retinex theory**, the algorithm determines the initial environmental light to obtain the incident component using a Gaussian approach. Next, the environmental light scattering attenuation rate is adjusted based on an information loss constraint to prevent overexposure or underexposure. To suppress halo artifacts and improve edge preservation, a weighted guided filter is employed, with BHSD ensuring smooth intensity transitions while maintaining natural color reproduction.  

Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm significantly enhances low illumination images across various scenes, improving the visibility of fine details and edge richness. It reproduces colors with greater accuracy, ensuring naturalness and aesthetic quality. This makes the algorithm well-suited for applications in surveillance, photography, and computer vision tasks, where reliable image enhancement is crucial in varying lighting conditions. The proposed method outperforms existing techniques, addressing limitations like halo effects and information loss effectively.
